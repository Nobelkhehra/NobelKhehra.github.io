            <p>
              In "ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM" a voter can use his/her voting right online without any difficulty. He/She has to be registered first for him/her to vote. 
              Registration is mainly done by the system administrator for security reasons. The system Adminstrator registers the voters on a special site of the system 
              visited by him only by simply filling a registration form to register voter. After registration, the voter is assigned a secret Voter ID with which he/she can use to log into the 
              system and enjoy services provide by the system such as voting. If invalid/wrong details are submitted, then the citizen is not registered to vote.
